# Water-Monitor
The Water Level Monitoring System uses an Arduino and water sensor to detect the presence of water. When water is detected, it triggers a Red LED and a Buzzer for alerting. If no water is detected, a Green LED is turned on.  Benefits:  • Monitors water levels in tanks.  • Early flood detection.  • Helps in smart irrigation control
